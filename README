DESCRIPTION
    POE::Component::Metabase::Client::Submit provides a POE mechanism for
    submitting facts to a Metabase web server.

CONSTRUCTOR
    "submit"
          POE::Component::Metabase::Client::Submit->spawn( %args );

        Constructs a POE session that will manage submitting a Metabase fact
        to a Metabase web server.

        Takes a number of mandatory arguments:

         'profile', a Metabase::User::Profile object
         'secret', a Metabase::User::Secret object
         'fact', a Metabase::Fact object
         'event', an event handler in the calling session to invoke on completion
         'uri', the uri of a Metabase server to submit to.

        And some optional arguments:

         'session', a session alias, reference or ID to send 'event' to instead of the calling session
         'http_alias', the alias or ID of an existing POE::Component::Client::HTTP session to use.
         'context', anything that can be stored in a scalar that is meaningful to you.
         'resolver', a reference to a POE::Component::Resolver object to use (ignored if http_alias is used).

OUTPUT EVENT
    An event will be sent to either the calling session or the session
    specified with "session" during "submit".

    "ARG0" of the event will be a hashref with the following keys:

    "success"
        Indicates that the submission was successful.

    "error"
        If there was an error this will contain a string indicating the
        error that occurred.

    "context"
        If you specified "context" in "submit", whatever you passed will be
        here.

    <content>
        This will contain the content of any HTTP responses whether success
        or failure.
