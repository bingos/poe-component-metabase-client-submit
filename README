NAME
    POE::Component::Metabase::Client::Submit - a POE client that submits to
    Metabase servers

SYNOPSIS
DESCRIPTION
    POE::Component::Metabase::Client::Submit provides a POE mechanism for
    submitting facts to a Metabase web server.

CONSTRUCTOR
    "submit"
          POE::Component::Metabase::Client::Submit->spawn( %args );

        Constructs a POE session that will manage submitting a Metabase fact
        to a Metabase web server.

        Takes a number of mandatory arguments:

         'profile', a Metabase::User::Profile object
         'secret', a Metabase::User::Secret object
         'fact', a Metabase::Fact object  
         'event', an event handler in the calling session to invoke on completion

        And some optional arguments:

         'session', a session alias, reference or ID to send 'event' to instead of the calling session
         'http_alias', the alias or ID of an existing POE::Component::Client::HTTP session to use.
         'context', anything that can be stored in a scalar that is meaningful to you.

OUTPUT EVENT
    An event will be sent to either the calling session or the session
    specified with "session" during "submit".

    "ARG0" of the event will be a hashref with the following keys:

    "success"
        Indicates that the submission was successful.

    "error"
        If there was an error this will contain a string indicating the
        error that occurred.

    "context"
        If you specified "context" in "submit", whatever you passed will be
        here.
